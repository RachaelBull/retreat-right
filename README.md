# Retreat Right

## Introduction

Welcome to Retreat Right. A travel blogging website based solely on my personal reviews and recomendations upon where I've travelled to and where I think that other people would like. Users can sign up, sign in, read already created blog posts, comment on posts and create and update their own profile.

This site is based around user authentication and user interactivity to create a feeling that the user is safe and in control whilst on this website.

## Strategy

My aim is to bring in people that are serious and passionate about trying new things and wanting to see the world from other peoples views and angles. In order to do this I took a mental note that I would have to keep my target audience in mind at all times in order to achieve this goal.

My intended audience is:
- People of any age as my posts are adventurous, spontanious and diverse.
- Individuals that are passionate about travel and adventure.
- People who love to try new things and are keen on reading from other peoples experiences.

How I will draw in my audience:
- I will aim to try and captivate my audience by producing well written, well formatted, relevent and intruiging posts to create a feel as though the user was there with me.
- I will regularly update my posts to keep users entertained and to keep fresh content flowing through the website.
